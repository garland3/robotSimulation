robotSimulation

Robot simulaion using 3D enviroment created using XNA game studio. Robot travels in the enviroment around the track trying to detect white lines. The robot has a virtual camera that you can see in the topright corner when you run the simulation. The robot calculates the average clear path and the makes a turn based on this number. 

The purpose of the simulation was to test a modification of the Hough transform algorithm. 

The mouse, and keys F1,F2,F3,F4,s,d,f,e,up,down,left,right control the robot.
